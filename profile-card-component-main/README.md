## My process
- I considered the background as main section
- Main section contain a subsection with id center and is placed at the center of page using display=flex in css
- I divided subsection into three parts and before that I displayed profile pic which will be floating on subsection, done by using position as absolute
- subsection is divided into center 1 (height: 40%), center 2(height: 40%), center3 (height: 20%)
- center 2 holds Name, numerical value and place
- center 3 holds the details of the profile

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to position the image over the center 1 (section), and an interesting thing is that I gave the same id name to the three subsection in center 3 since their styling looked similar and it worked wonderful.


### Continued development

I want to develop few other projects so that I can more clear understanding in building the projects using frame work up ahead.



### Useful resources

- [Css Generator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) - This helped me to create box shadow with desired blurness and spread radius. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
